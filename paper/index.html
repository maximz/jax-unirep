                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>UniRep is a recurrent neural network,
trained using self-supervision
on 24 million protein sequences
to predict the next amino acid in a sequence [@alley2019unified].
Its most powerful model allows for embedding
arbitrary length sequences in a 1900-long feature vector
that can be used as the input to a "top model"
for unsupervised clustering or supervised prediction of protein properties.</p>
<p>The original model was implemented in TensorFlow 1.13 [@abadi2016tensorflow],
and its original API only allowed
for one sequence to be transformed at once.
While test-driving the model,
we observed two problems with it.
The first is that that the original implementation
took an abnormally long amount of time
to process multiple sequences,
requiring on the order of dozens of seconds to process single sequences.
The second was that its API was not sufficiently flexible
to handle multiple sequences passed in at once;
to get reps of multiple sequences,
one needed to write a manual for-loop,
re-using a function inside which returns the reps for
a single sequence.
When fine-tuning model weights,
sequences needed to be batched and padded to equal lengths
before being able to be passed in to the model.
Neither appeared to be user-friendly.</p>
<p>Thus, while the model itself holds great potential
for the protein engineering field,
the API prevents us from using it conveniently and productively.
We thus sought to reimplement and package the model
in a way that brings a robust yet easy-to-use experience
to protein modellers and engineers.</p>
<p>In particular, our engineering goals were to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A function that can process multiple sequences of arbitrary lengths,</li>
<li>Vectorizing the inputs to make it fast.</li>
<li>A single function call to "evotune" the global weights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="profiling-tf-unirep-and-jax-unirep">Profiling tf-unirep and jax-unirep</h2>
<p>To investigate the performance of the original and our reimplementation,
we used Python's <code>cProfile</code> facility to identify
where the majority of time was spent in the respective codebases.
The functions used for profiling were:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># assume babbler is imported from tf-unirep</span>

<p>We then used SnakeViz to visualize the code execution profile results.</p>

" src="../figures/jax-unirep-profile.png" /></p>
<p>As is visible from the code execution flamegraph,
the unreasonably long time that it takes to process ten sequences
was probably due to the time spent in TensorFlow's session.
Because of TensorFlow's compiled nature,
we thus deduced that the majority of the execution time
was most likely in the graph compilation phase.
Unfortunately, cProfile could not give us any further detail
beyond the <code>_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.TF_SessionRun_wrapper</code>
in the call graph,
meaning we were unable to conveniently peer into the internals of TF execution
without digging further.</p>
<p>On the basis of this profiling,
we hypothesized that the cause of speed problems was graph compilation in TF1.x,
and that we could obtain speedups by using a non-graph-compiled tensor library.
There were three choices for us at this point: TF2.x, PyTorch and JAX,
and we chose the latter.
Our choice was motivated by the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>JAX uses the NumPy API,
which is idiomatic in the Python scientific computing community.</li>
<li>JAX provides automatic differentiation,
which would enable us to reimplement weights fine-tuning.</li>
<li>JAX encourages functional programming,
which makes implementation of neural network layers
different from class-based implementations (e.g. PyTorch and Keras).
This was an intellectual curiosity point for us.</li>
<li>JAX is "eagerly" executable like PyTorch and TF2,
which aids debugging.</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides these <em>a priori</em> motivating reasons,
we also uncovered other reasons to use JAX midway:</p>
<ol>
<li>JAX's compiled and automatically differentiable primitives (e.g. <code>lax.scan</code>)
allowed us to write performant RNN code.</li>
<li><code>jit</code> and <code>vmap</code> helped with writing performant training loops.</li>
</ol>
<p>We thus reimplemented the model in JAX/NumPy.
(See "Reimplementation Main Points" section for details.)
As is visible from the code profiling APIs that we used,
we designed a cleaner and more expressive API
that could be faster
and handle multiple sequences of variable lengths,
without introducing the mental overhead
of TensorFlow's complex scoping syntax.
An expressive and clean API was something that we would expect
a computational protein engineer would desire,
as having this API form would lower mental overhead
while also hopefully being faster to execute and write.</p>
<p>A formal speed comparison using the same CPU is available below.</p>
<p><img alt="
    Speed comparison between the original implementation (UniRep)
    and our re-implementation (Jax-UniRep).
    Both one and ten random sequences of length ten
    were transformed by both implementations.
    Our re-implementation could make use of vectorization
    in the multi-sequence case,
    whereas in the original implementation the sequences were transformed
    one at a time.
" src="../figures/speed_comparison.png#center" />{width=50%}</p>
<p>We also needed to check that our reimplementation correctly embeds sequences.
To do so, we ran a dummy sequence
through the original and through our reimplementation,
and compared the computed representations.
Because it is 1900-long, a visual check for correctness
is a trace of 1900-long embedding.</p>
<p><img alt="
    Comparison of the average hidden state between the implementations
    when transforming the same sequence.
    Because the two traces of the hidden state dimensions overlapped
    almost perfectly, a small constant was added to the UniRep values,
    such that both traces become visible. The inset shows
    50 out of the total 1900 dimensions.
" src="../figures/rep_trace_lf.png" /></p>
<p>We also verified that the embeddings calculated using the pre-trained weights
were informative for top models,
and trained a model to predict the brightness
of around 50'000 avGFP variants (as the authors did).
avGFP is a green-fluorescent protein
that has been extensively studied in the literature.
Many studies generated mutants of this protein,
measuring the changes in brightness for each mutant,
to try to understand how protein sequence links to function or simply
to increase brightness.</p>
<p>We binarized brightness values into a "dark" and a "bright" class,
and used scikit-learn's implementation of logistic regression for classification.
Average performance across 5-fold cross-validation is shown in Figure 3.
(avGFP data came from [@sarkisyan2016local].)</p>

<h2 id="reimplementation-main-points">Reimplementation Main Points</h2>
<h3 id="choice-of-jax">Choice of JAX</h3>
<p>JAX was our library choice to reimplement it in,
because it provides automatic differentiation machinery [@jax2018github]
on top of the highly idiomatic and widely-used NumPy API [@oliphant2006guide].
JAX uses a number of components shared with TensorFlow,
in particular the use of the
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) library
to provide automatic compilation from the NumPy API to GPU and TPU.</p>
<p>Part of the exercise was also pedagogical:
by reimplementing the model in a pure NumPy API,
we are forced to become familiar with the mechanics of the model,
and learn the translation between NumPy and TensorFlow operations.
This helps us be flexible in moving between frameworks.</p>
<p>Because JAX provides automatic differentiation
and a number of optimization routines as utility functions,
we are thus not prohibited from fine-tuning UniRep weights
through gradient descent.</p>
<p>During the reimplementation,
we also discovered that JAX provided convenient utilities
(<code>lax.scan</code>, <code>vmap</code>, and <code>jit</code>)
to convert loops into fast, vectorized operations on tensors.
This had a pleasant effect of helping us write more performant code.
We were also forced to reason clearly
about the semantic meaning of our tensor dimensions,
to make sure that vecotrization happened over the correct axes.
We commented at every tensor operation step
how the shapes of our input(s) and output(s) should look like.
One example from our source:</p>

<h3 id="tensor-ops-reimplementation">Tensor Ops Reimplementation</h3>
<p>The process of tensor ops reimplementation were as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, we started from the RNN cell (<code>mLSTM1900_step</code>),
which sequentially walks down the protein sequence
and generates the single step embedding.
We thus end up with a "unit cell" function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mlstm1900_step</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">carry</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x_t</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">h_t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">carry</span>
    <span class="c1"># Unit cell implementation goes here.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">h_t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_t</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">h_t</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Secondly, we wrapped the RNN cell using <code>lax.scan</code>
to scan over a single sequence.
This is the <code>mlstm1900_batch</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mlstm1900_batch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">batch</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># code setup goes here.</span>
    <span class="n">step_func</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">partial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mlstm1900_step</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># use of lax.scan below:</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">h_final</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_final</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">outputs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">lax</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">scan</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">step_func</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">init</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">h_t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_t</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">xs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">batch</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Thirdly, we then used <code>jax.vmap</code>
to vectorize the operation over multiple sequences,
thus generating <code>mlstm1900</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mlstm1900</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">mlstm1900_vmappable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">mlstm1900_batch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">batch</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="n">h_final</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_final</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">outputs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vmap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mlstm1900_vmappable</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">h_final</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c_final</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">outputs</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Effectively, <code>jax.vmap</code> and <code>lax.scan</code>
replace for-loops that we would otherwise write,
which would incur Python type-checking overhead that would accumulate.
<code>lax.scan</code> being effectively a pre-compiled for-loop
enables pre-allocation of the necessary memory needed for backpropagation,
which also contributes to a speed-up.
As the for-loop type checking penalty is well-known in Python,
a detailed comparison between <code>jax.vmap</code>, <code>lax.scan</code>, and a vanilla <code>for</code> loop
is out of scope for this paper.
The full source code is available in <code>jax_unirep/layers.py</code>.</p>
<p>Besides reimplementation,
we also took care to document the semantic meaning of tensor dimensions.
This had the pleasant side effect of forcing us
to order our tensor dimensions in a sane fashion,
such that the "batch" or "sample" dimension was always the first one,
with explicit documentation written to guide a new user on this convention.</p>
<p>While reimplementing the model, we also generated a test suite for it.
Most of our tests check that the shapes of returned tensors were correct.
For the unit RNN cell, we provided an example-based test with random matrices.
The same applied to the batch function.
However, for the full forward model, we provided a property-based test,
which checked that tensor dimensions were correct
given different numbers of samples.
These are available in the source <code>tests/</code> directory.
As a known benefit with software testing,
our tests allowed us to rebuild the full model piece by piece,
while always making sure that each new piece did not break
the existing pieces.</p>
<h3 id="utility-reimplementation">Utility Reimplementation</h3>
<p>For the <code>get_reps()</code> functionality,
we copied quite a bit of source code from the original,
including the original authors' implementation of
embedding a sequence into an <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">l</span><script type="math/tex">l</script></span>-by-10 embedding matrix first.
However, we added tests to guarantee that they were robust,
as well as technical documentation to clarify how it works.</p>
<p>We did this because one way that deep learning models can be fragile
is that the input tensors can be generated incorrectly
but still have the expected shapes.
Thus, though the structure of input tensors might be correct,
their semantic meaning would be completely wrong.
(Adversarial examples can be generated this way.)
Thus, the input to the model has to be carefully controlled.
Moreover, input tensors are <em>not</em> the raw-est form of data;
for a protein engineer, the protein sequence is.
Thus, having robustly tested functions that generate the input tensors
with correct semantic meaning
is crucial to having confidence
that the model works correctly end-to-end.</p>
<h3 id="apis">APIs</h3>
<p>Because we expect the model to be used as a Python library,
the model source and weights are packaged together.
This makes it much more convenient for end-users,
as the cognitive load of downloading starter weights is eliminated.</p>
<p>The <code>get_reps()</code> function is designed
such that it is flexible enough to accept a single sequence
or an iterable of sequences.
This also reduces cognitive load for end-users,
some of whom might want to process only a single sequence,
while others might be operating in batch mode.
<code>get_reps()</code> also correctly handles sequences of multiple lengths,
further simplifying usage for end-users.
In particular, we spent time ensuring that
<code>get_reps()</code> correctly batches sequences of the same size together
before calculating their reps,
while returning the reps in the same order as the sequences passed in.
As usual, tests are provided,
bringing the same degree of confidence as we would expect
from tested software.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>We found the reimplementation exercise to be highly educational.
In particular, we gained a mechanical understanding of the model,
and through documenting the model functions thoroughly
with the semantic meaning of tensor dimensions,
we were able to greatly reduce our own confusion when
debugging why the model would fail.</p>
<p>During the reimplementation,
we found the "sigmoid" function to be an overloaded term.
We initially used a sigmoid that had an incorrect slope,
yielding incorrect reps.
Switching to the correct sigmoid slope rectified the problem.
A similar lesson was learned while reimplementing the L2 norm of our weights.</p>
<p>Writing automated tests for the model functions,
in basically the same way as we would test software,
gave us the confidence that our code changes would not
inadvertently break existing functionality that was also already tested.
We also could then more easily narrow down where failures were happening
when developing new code that interacted with the model
(such as providing input tensors).</p>
<p>Through reimplementation, we took the opportunity to document
the semantic meaning of tensor axes and their order,
thus enabling ourselves to better understand the model's semantic structure,
while also enabling others to more easily participate
in the model's improvement and development.</p>
<p>Competing tensor libraries that do not interoperate seamlessly
means data scientists are forced to learn one
(and be mentally locked in).
To break free of framework lock-in,
being able to translate between frameworks is highly valuable.
Model reimplementation was highly beneficial for this.</p>
<p>UniRep was implemented in Tensorflow 1.13.
It is well-known that TF1's computation graph-oriented API
does not promote ease of debugging in native Python.
Hence, it may sometimes be difficult to find spots in a TF model
where one could speed up computations.
By instead treating neural network layers as functions
that are eagerly evaluated,
we could more easily debug model problems,
in particular, the pernicious tensor shape issues.</p>
<p>We believe that the speedup that we observed by reimplementing in JAX
came primarily from eliminating graph compilation overhead
and an enhanced version of the original API design.
In anecdotal tests, graph compilation would take on the order of seconds
before any computation occurred.
Because the original implementation's <code>get_reps</code> function
did not accept multiple sequences,
one had to use a for-loop to pass sequence strings through the model.
If a user were not careful,
in a worst-case scenario,
they would end up essentially paying the compilation penalty
on every loop iteration.</p>
<p>By preprocessing strings in batches of the same size,
and by keeping track of the original ordering,
then we could (1) avoid compilation penalty,
and (2) vectorize much of the tensor operations over the sample axis,
before returning the representation vectors in the original order of the sequences.
In ensuring that the enhanced <code>get_reps</code> API accepted multiple sequences,
we also reduced cognitive load for a Python-speaking protein data scientist
who might be seeking to use the model,
as the function safely handles a single string and an iterable of strings.</p>
<p>An overarching lesson we derive from this experience is as follows.
If "models are software 2.0" [@kaparthy2017software2],
then data science teams might do well
to treat fitted model weights as software artefacts
that are shipped to end-users,
and take care to design sane APIs
that enable other developers to use it in ways
that minimize cognitive load.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>As we have, at this point, only implemented the 1900-cell model.
Going forth, we aim to work on implementing the 256- and 64-cell model.</p>
<p>Evotuning is an important task when using UniRep [@alley2019unified],
and we aim to provide a convenient API through the <code>evotune()</code> function.
Here, we plan to use Optuna
to automatically find the right hyperparameters for finetuning weights,
using the protocol that the original authors describe.
This would enable end-users to "set and forget" the model fitting protocol
rather than needing to babysit a deep learning optimization routine.
Like <code>get_reps()</code>, <code>evotune()</code> and its associated utility functions
will have at least an example-based test,
if not also a property-based test associated with them.</p>
<p>Community contributions and enhancements are welcome as well.</p>
